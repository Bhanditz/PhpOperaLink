Instructions
============

INSTALLING PHP ON UBUNTU/DEBIAN

Skip this part if you already have access to a web server that can run PHP.

$> sudo aptitude install apache2
$> sudo aptitude install php5 php5-dev php-pear
$> sudo a2enmod php5
$> sudo mkdir -p /var/www/link
$> sudo chown www-data:www-data /var/www/link

INSTALLING OAUTH PHP LIB

If you do not control your server, you will need to ask your administrator
to install this module.

$> sudo apt-get install build-essential libcurl-devel libpcre3-dev
$> sudo pecl install oauth
$> sudo su -c 'echo "extension=oauth.so" > /etc/php5/apache2/conf.d/oauth.ini'
$> sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart

The manual is here http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.oauth.php

ENABLE PHP LOGGING IF YOU LIKE

If you do not control your server, you will need to ask your administrator
to install this module.

Edit /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini and uncomment the error_log line
error_log = /var/log/php_errors.log

$> sudo touch /var/log/php_errors.log
$> sudo chown www-data:www-data /var/log/php_errors.log
$> sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart

CHECK OUT THE EXAMPLE

$> cd ~
$> git clone git://github.com/operasoftware/PhpOperaLink
$> cd PhpOperaLink

Copy the code to your web server
$> cp -R *.php css /var/www/link/

REGISTER YOUR APP ON https://auth.opera.com/service/oauth/application/new

Choose "Web Application"
For the callback URL, choose http://127.0.0.1/link/index.php (or use
the name of the server that you are deploying this on.)
Edit config.php and put in the key and secret that you are granted

TRY IT
Visit http://127.0.0.1/link/index.php (or the name of the server that you
